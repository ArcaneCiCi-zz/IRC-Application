# IRC-Application
A simple Java based IRC Application, with the idea of complete anonymity.

Use any alias you want, any time, any place.

## Compiling
    Run "mvn clean install" on both modules.

## Usage
    Running this application is very easy.
    I've gone ahead and done their own sections below.

### Client
    Run compiled JAR with the arguments:
    --username <name> --asseturl <url> 
    
    The default asset url is "ws://0.0.0.0:9099/connect"

### Server
    Run compiled JAR, no arguments required.
    This will change in a later update.
